# ANALYZING-SUICIDE-TRENDS-THROUGH-EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-AND-MACHINE-LEARNING

Suicide is one of the 1eading causes of death among a11 adu1ts and rates are 
increasing in both men and women. But numbers also show stark differences 
between genders.
In 2017, men died by suicide 3.54 times more often than women. Midd1e-aged 
white men, in particu1ar, are susceptible. White males accounted for near1y 70-
percent of suicide deaths in 2017, according to the American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention.
“There can be a stigma among men that they shou1d ‘tough things out,’ rather 
than seeking he1p if they’re having strugg1es with their menta1 hea1th,” says Dr. 
Lisa Baker, an SSM Hea1th Psycho1ogist at St. Mary’s Hospita1 - Madison. “As 
a resu1t, menta1 hea1th conditions are under-reported and under-detected in men, 
1eaving them vu1nerable to suicide.”
People who live in rural areas are at higher risk of suicide than their urban 
counterparts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This, 
in part, can be explained by greater access to firearms, drug and alcohol use and 
a scarce of health care providers and emergency medical services. Cultural factors 
are also a barrier to accessing care and getting support from family and friends.
To perform Data Analysis and wants you to examine trends & correlations
within our data. We would like to make a Machine Learning algorithm where 
we can train our AI to learn & improve from experience. Thus, we would want 
to predict the amount of suicides numbers in a certain demographic.
This project seeks to explore the underlying factors. We will use a sample of 
44,000 data points gathered from 141 different countries, between the 80’s to 
2016.
Research Questions
1. Which year has the most suicides? Which year has the least suicides?
2. Which country has the most suicides? Which country has the least 
suicides?
3. Are certain age groups more inclined to suicide?
4. What is the relationship between gender and the number of suicides?
Features & Predictor:
Our Predictor (Y, Suicide Count) is determined by 5 features (X):
1. country (Categorical)
2. year: year of suicide (Categorical)
3. sex: Male, Female (Categorical)
4. age (Categorical)
5. population: (#)


CONCLUSION
1. There was a decrease in suicides toward the 80’s. This could be due to 
awareness of suicide & mental health in the 80s, as well as improved
recognition of those at risk. But shortly after that their is a rise suicides that 
we are seeing.
2. Russian levels of alcohol consumption plays an immense role in it’s large 
suicide count, but their is a lack of data to support this due to Soviet 
secrecy.
3. The data illustrates that middle aged adults, between the ages of 30 through 
60, have the highest suicide count. While elderly and adolescents have 
about half the amount as middle aged adults.
4. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among all Americans adults. 
Data show alarming differences in suicide for different sexes. It’s evident 
that males are more inclined to suicide, than females. In addition, Mental 
health is a major predictor for suicide.
